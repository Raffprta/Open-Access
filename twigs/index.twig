                Welcome to <strong>Open Access</strong> a publication system where you can search, view and upload (if you are a faculty member)
                publications for users to access. We pride ourselves in implementing an open source based model on not just code, but raw data,
                formal publications and mobile applications. You do not need an account to browse our publications, however it is convenient to
                make one to access the extra features present within the site such as bookmarking your favourite open access publication or 
                commenting on a publication. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our site is based on the tenet of accessibility and ease of use, in which we promise a fast and intuitive way of accessing the 
                material at your leisure. This can be viewed as an extension of our currently existing library system and university catalouge 
                where books can be perused both as physical copies and e-books. Below is the Robinson Library, where accessing and ordering
                textbooks and other research materials is possible via the university system. We aim to extend that by providing a system 
                which is more user friendly and tailored to the upload of more ranges of material (such as code) to fulfil further requirements.

            <h4> Libraries from antiquity... to now </h4>
            <p>
                The first libraries consisted of archives of the earliest form of writingâ€”the clay tablets in cuneiform script discovered in
                temple rooms in Sumer, some dating back to 2600 BC.[3] These archives, which mainly consisted of the records of commercial transactions
                or inventories, mark the end of prehistory and the start of history.
            </p>
            <p>
                From then, the Library of Alexandria, in Egypt, was the largest and most significant great library of the ancient world.
                It flourished under the patronage of the Ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship from its construction in 
                the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Libraries have flourished since the days of antiquity to modern private collections, to edifices offering vast amounts of books
                to the public, to the digital age which displays open access text to be perused digitally.
